GENERAL\n\n          The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements presented\n     herein include the accounts of Dynamark Corporation. The foregoing\n     statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring\n     adjustments) which are, in the opinion of the Company's management,\n     necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of\n     April 30, 2000, and the statements of operations and cash flows for the\n     three month and nine month periods ended April 30, 2000 and 1999 and from\n     inception (August 1, 1986) through April 30, 2000. Certain information and\n     footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements have been\n     condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the\n     Securities and Exchange Commission. These condensed financial statements\n     should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes\n     thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year\n     ended July 31, 1999. The results of operations for the three and nine\n     months ended April 30, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of the results\n     of operations for the year ending July 31, 2000.\n\n2 - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n          The Company has been in the development stage since its inception on\n     August 1, 1986. It has not generated operating revenues as of April 30,\n     2000, and no assurance can be given that it will generate revenues and\n     earnings in the future.\n\n3 - CONSULTING AGREEMENT\n\n          During the year ended July 31, 1992, the Company entered into an\n     agreement with an entity to render consulting services to the Company in\n     identifying equity or debt financing and/or potential merger candidates.\n     Under the agreement, the Company paid a $5,000 nonrefundable fee to that\n     entity, which was included in professional fees for the year ended July 31,\n     1992. Pursuant to the agreement terms, the Company will be obligated to pay\n     an additional $5,000 upon identification of a potential source of financing\n     or a merger/acquisition candidate. The Company is also obligated to make an\n     additional $15,000 payment upon the successful closing (signed letter of\n     intent) of either a financing agreement or merger/acquisition. In addition,\n     the agreement provides that the consulting entity will receive shares of\n     Dynamark Corporation, which will be restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the\n     Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement specifies that it will\n     terminate upon successful identification of financing or a\n     merger/acquisition, or when it is terminated by one of the parties.\n\n\n\n                                   (Continued)\n\n                                       I-5\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                     NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n3 - CONSULTING AGREEMENT (Continued)\n\n          During the year ended July 31, 1992, the Company entered into a\n     transaction covered by the consulting agreement, which resulted in a letter\n     of intent qualifying for compensation under the agreement. During that\n     year, the transaction was aborted. The Company incurred consulting fees of\n     $2,500 to this consultant in settlement of its obligation concerning the\n     letter of intent.\n\n          As of April 30, 2000, there are no currently pending financings or\n     merger/acquisitions subject to this agreement, which remains in effect.\n\n\n                                       I-6\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n\n\n\nItem 2.         Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and\n                results of operations\n\n                o        Financial condition\n\n                               The Company's shareholders' equity (deficiency)\n                         was $(19,276) at April 30, 2000 compared to $2,569 at\n                         July 31, 1999, its most recent year-end. The decrease\n                         in shareholders' equity (deficiency) is due to the net\n                         loss of $21,845 sustained from operations for the nine\n                         months ended April 30, 2000.\n\n                                The Company's principal asset at April 30, 2000\n                         and July 31, 1999 is cash. Changes in the Company's\n                         cash balance result from the payment of operating\n                         expenses.\n\n                                The Company is expected to remain in the\n                         development stage for the foreseeable future. As such,\n                         it is likely to incur only professional fees and\n                         miscellaneous expenses.\n\n                o        Results of operations\n\n                               The Company had a net loss of $6,150 and $2,464\n                         for the three months ended April 30, 2000 and 1999,\n                         respectively, compared to a net loss of $21,845 and\n                         $17,011, respectively, for the nine months ended April\n                         30, 2000 and 1999.\n\n                o        Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n                                There have been no material changes in the\n                          Company's financial position, liquidity or capital\n                          resources since April 30, 2000, other than the effect\n                          of incurring normal operating expenses.\n\n\n                                       I-7\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                         QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2000\n\n\n\n\n                                   SIGNATURES\n\n         Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its\nbehalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\nDATE:                                 DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n\n\n\n                                      By:\n-------------------                      ---------------------------------------\n                                                   Allan Rothstein\n                                                   President and Director\n\n\n\n\n                                      II-1\n\n</TEXT>\n</DOCUMENT>\n"
