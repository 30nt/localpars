DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY\n\n          The Company, a Delaware corporation, has been in the development stage\n     since its formation on August 1, 1986. It has not generated operating\n     revenues as of April 30, 2002, and no assurance can be given that it will\n     generate operating revenues and earnings in the future.\n\n\n2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION\n\n          The condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance\n     with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial\n     information and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\n     Exchange Commission. They do not include all of the information and\n     footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete\n     financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments\n     (consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary\n     for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for\n     the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be\n     expected for the full year. The accompanying financial statements should be\n     read in conjunction with the Company\'s audited financial statements and\n     Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2001.\n\n\n3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n     Income Taxes\n\n          The Company applies the asset and liability method of accounting for\n     income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and\n     liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences\n     attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying\n     amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.\n     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax\n     rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are\n     expected to be recovered or settled.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   (Continued)\n\n                                       -5-\n<PAGE>\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\n\n\n3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n\n     Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\n\n          The Company applies SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share", which requires\n     dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for\n     complex capital structures on the face of the statement of operations.\n     Basic and diluted EPS has been computed by dividing the loss by the\n     weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. During\n     the three months ended April 30, 2002 and 2001, and nine months ended April\n     30, 2002, basic and diluted loss per share was less than $.01. The Company\n     has not issued any dilutive potential common stock since inception.\n\n     Investments\n\n\n          At April 30, 2002, the Company held 125,000 common shares of H Power\n     Corp., which are classified as available-for-sale securities.\n     Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized\n     holding gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, are\n     excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of\n     shareholders\' equity. Dividend and interest income are recognized when\n     earned.\n\n          In February 2002, the Company\'s U.S. Treasury bill matured. The\n     Company had classified this investment as held to maturity and did not\n     recognize any gain or loss on its disposition.\n\n4 - INVESTMENT IN H POWER CORP.\n\n          Prior to August 1, 2000, the Company accounted for its investment in H\n     Power Corp. using the equity method because it was part of a group of\n     certain related parties and affiliates which owned approximately 18 percent\n     of that corporation. During the year ended July 31, 1995, the Company\n     recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of value in this investment\n     due to H Power Corp.\'s continuing losses and wrote the carrying value down\n     to zero.\n\n\n\n                                   (Continued)\n\n                                       -6-\n<PAGE>\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\n\n\n4 - INVESTMENT IN H POWER CORP. (continued)\n\n          On August 10, 2000, H Power Corp. consummated an initial public\n     offering ("IPO"). In July 2000, in connection with the IPO, H Power Corp.\n     authorized a five-for-one split. In addition, in April 2000, certain\n     parties related to the Company agreed to resign from H Power Corp.\'s Board\n     of Directors and accept certain restrictions on voting and transferring\n     their shares and seeking proxies. Consequently, the group of related\n     parties and affiliates no longer exercises significant influence over H\n     Power Corp. and, beginning in the quarter ended October 31, 2000, the\n     Company accounted for the investment as available-for-sale marketable\n     equity securities. The unrealized holding (loss) gain on the H Power Corp.\n     shares, which are reflected in other comprehensive income, was $(495,000)\n     and $91,100 for the nine months ended April 30, 2002 and 2001,\n     respectively. At April 30, 2002, the H Power Corp. shares had a quoted\n     market price of $2.07 per share, for a total investment of $258,750.\n\n\n5 - INCOME TAXES\n\n          The primary components of the Company\'s deferred tax assets and\n     liabilities and the related valuation allowances are as follows:\n\n                                                     April 30,       July 31,\n                                                       2002            2001\n                                                   ------------    ------------\n          Gross deferred tax assets\n            Net operating loss carryforwards       $    162,860    $    162,830\n\n          Valuation allowance                            78,697          34,480\n                                                   ------------    ------------\n\n                                                         84,163         128,350\n\n          Gross deferred tax liabilities\n            Unrealized gain on investments               84,163         256,275\n                                                   ------------    ------------\n\n                                                   $     -0-       $    127,925\n                                                   ============    ============\n\n\n\n                                   (Continued)\n\n                                       -7-\n<PAGE>\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\n\n\n5 - INCOME TAXES (Continued)\n\n          At April 30, 2002, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of\n     approximately $479,000, expiring during the years 2004 to 2021, available\n     to reduce future Federal taxable income. The Company believes that\n     realization of part of the deferred tax asset related to its net operating\n     loss carryforward was more likely than not, based on its accumulated\n     unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of $258,750 at April 30,\n     2002. In 2002, the Company recorded a valuation allowance, partially\n     offsetting the deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance was based on\n     management\'s estimates and analysis that it was more likely than not that\n     the related deferred tax assets would not be realized.\n\n\n6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\n          The Company rents its principal office space from its president on a\n     month-to-month basis at $500 per month. Rent expense incurred was $4,500\n     for each of the nine months ended April 30, 2002 and 2001.\n\n          At April 30, 2002 and July 31, 2001, the balance due to officer\n     consists of noninterest-bearing amounts payable to the president of the\n     Company as follows:\n\n                                                      2002             2001\n                                                  ------------     ------------\n\n                   Officer\'s salary               $    125,961     $    125,961\n                   Rent                                 62,500           58,000\n                                                  ------------     ------------\n\n                                                  $    188,461     $    183,961\n                                                  ============     ============\n\n          These liabilities have been classified as noncurrent based on the\n     president\'s intent not to demand payment before May 1, 2003.\n\n\n7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT\n\n          At May 23, 2002, the H Power Corp. common shares had a quoted market\n     value of $1.29 per share. The Company owns 125,000 common shares of H Power\n     Corp.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n<PAGE>\n\nItem 2.  Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of\n         Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n         Financial Condition.\n\n                  The Company is a development stage company and has had minimal\n         revenue to date. The Company is relying on existing resources to fund\n         its continuing operation. Additional sources of liquidity are expected\n         to be available from the Company\'s investment in H Power Corp.\'s common\n         shares. During the year ended July 31, 1995, the Company wrote the\n         carrying value of this investment to zero due to H Power Corp.\'s\n         continuing losses. On August 10, 2000, H Power Corp. consummated an\n         initial public offering (IPO). In connection with this IPO, H Power\n         Corp. authorized a five to one split, which increased the number of the\n         Company\'s shares to 125,000. In addition, in April 2000, certain\n         parties related to the Company agreed to resign from H Power Corp\'s\n         Board of Directors and accept certain restrictions on voting and\n         transferring their shares and seeking proxies. Consequently, the group\n         of related parties and affiliates no longer exercises significant\n         influence over H Power Corp. and, beginning in the quarter ending\n         October 31, 2000, the Company accounted for the investment as\n         available-for sale marketable equity securities. In prior periods the\n         investment was accounted for using the equity method. At April 30,\n         2002, the H Power Corp. shares had a quoted market price of $2.07 per\n         share, for a total investment of $258,750. On this basis, the Company\n         reported at April 30, 2002, an unrealized holding loss on the H Power\n         shares in the amount of $62,500, less the income tax benefit of\n         $24,375, available from net loss carryforwards of approximately\n         $479,000.\n\n\n\n         Results of Operations\n\n                  The Company reported a net loss of $30,164 for the three-month\n         period ended April 30, 2002, compared to a net loss of $1,968 for the\n         three-month period ended April 30, 2001. The loss reported for the\n         period ended April 30, 2002 was attributable primarily to income tax\n         expense of $24,375, which resulted from a reduction of the realization\n         of its net operating loss carryforwards due to the Company\'s unrealized\n         loss on the H-Power shares.\n<PAGE>\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2002\n\n\n\n\n                                   SIGNATURES\n                                   ----------\n\n\n         Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its\nbehalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\n\n\n\nDATE:                                      DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n\n\n\n                                           By:\n----------------------------                  ----------------------------------\n                                                   Allan Rothstein\n                                                   President and Director\n\n\n                                       -1-\n\n</TEXT>\n</DOCUMENT>\n'
