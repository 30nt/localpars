 DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n1 - DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY\n\n          The Company, a Delaware corporation, has been in the development stage\n     since its formation on August 1, 1986. It has not generated operating\n     revenues as of October 31, 2000, and no assurance can be given that it will\n     generate operating revenues and earnings in the future.\n\n2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION\n\n          The condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance\n     with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial\n     information and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\n     Exchange Commission. They do not include all of the information and\n     footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete\n     financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments\n     (consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary\n     for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for\n     the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be\n     expected for the full year. The accompanying financial statements should be\n     read in conjunction with the Company\'s audited financial statements and\n     Form 10-k for the year ended July 31, 2000.\n\n3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n     Income Taxes\n\n          The Company applies the asset and liability method of accounting for\n     income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and\n     liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences\n     attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying\n     amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.\n     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax\n     rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are\n     expected to be recovered or settled.\n\n\n                                   (Continued)\n\n                                       -5-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\n\n     Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\n\n          The Company applies SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share", which requires\n     dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for\n     complex capital structures on the face of the statement of operations.\n     Basic and diluted EPS has been computed by dividing the loss by the\n     weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. During\n     the three months ended October 31, 1999, basic and diluted loss per share\n     was less than $.01. The Company has not issued any dilutive potential\n     common stock since inception.\n\n     Investments\n\n          At October 31, 2000, the Company held 125,000 common shares of H Power\n     Corp., which are classified as available-for-sale securities.\n     Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized\n     holding gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, are\n     excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of\n     shareholders\' equity. Dividend and interest income are recognized when\n     earned.\n\n          The Company has classified a six-month U.S. Treasury bill as\n     held-to-maturity. This security has a face value of $150,000 and matures in\n     November 2000. Accrued interest on this security is included in\n     investments.\n\n     Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\n          In September 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued\n     SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities",\n     which requires entities to recognize all derivatives in their financial\n     statements as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. SFAS 133\n     also specifies new methods of accounting for hedging transactions,\n     prescribes the items and transactions that may be hedged and specifies\n     detailed criteria to be met to qualify for hedge accounting. SFAS 133, as\n     amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138, is effective for fiscal quarters\n     beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company currently does not use\n     derivative instruments as defined by SFAS Nos. 133 and 138 and,\n     accordingly, these statements have no effect on its results of operations\n     or its financial position.\n\n\n                                   (Continued)\n\n                                       -6-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\n\n     Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (Continued)\n\n          In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff\n     released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in\n     Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"). SAB 101 provides interpretive guidance\n     on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial\n     statements. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SAB 101 will\n     have a material effect on the Company\'s financial results.\n\n     Reclassifications\n\n          Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial\n     statements to conform to the current year presentation.\n\n4 - INVESTMENT IN H POWER CORP.\n\n          Prior to August 1, 2000, the Company accounted for its investment in H\n     Power Corp. using the equity method because it was part of a group of\n     certain related parties and affiliates which owned approximately 18 percent\n     of that corporation. During the year ended July 31, 1995, the Company\n     recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of value in this investment\n     due to H Power Corp.\'s continuing losses and wrote the carrying value down\n     to zero.\n\n          On August 10, 2000, H Power Corp. consummated an initial public\n     offering ("IPO"). In July 2000, in connection with the IPO, H Power Corp.\n     authorized a five-for-one split. In addition, in April 2000, certain\n     parties related to the Company agreed to resign from H Power Corp.\'s Board\n     of Directors and accept certain restrictions on voting and transferring\n     their shares and seeking proxies. Consequently, the group of related\n     parties and affiliates no longer exercises significant influence over H\n     Power Corp. and, beginning in the quarter ending October 31, 2000, the\n     Company accounted for the investment as available-for-sale marketable\n     equity securities. At October 31, 2000, the H Power Corp. shares had a\n     quoted market price of $21.3125 per share, for a total investment of\n     $2,664,063.\n\n\n                                   (Continued)\n\n                                       -7-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n5 - INCOME TAXES\n\n          At July 31, 2000, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of\n     approximately $444,000, expiring during the years 2004 to 2020, available\n     to reduce future Federal taxable income. In accordance with Statement of\n     Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income\n     Taxes", the Company had recorded a valuation allowance fully offsetting the\n     deferred tax asset related to its net operating loss carryforwards. The\n     valuation allowance was based on management\'s estimates and analysis that\n     it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets would not\n     be realized.\n\n          During the three months ended October 31, 2000, the Company recorded\n     an unrealized gain on marketable securities of approximately $2 million,\n     net of taxes, in other comprehensive income. Based on this unrealized gain,\n     the Company believes that the realization of deferred tax benefits was more\n     likely than not and, accordingly, reduced the valuation allowance to zero.\n\n          The primary components of the Company\'s deferred tax assets and\n     liabilities and the related valuation allowances are as follows:\n\n                                                     Three Months Ended\n                                                         October 31,\n                                                   ---------------------\n\n                                                      2000        1999\n                                                   ---------   ---------\n\n       Gross deferred tax assets\n         Net operating loss carryforwards          $ 150,960   $ 444,000\n\n       Valuation allowance                              --      (444,000)\n\n       Gross deferred tax liabilities\n         Unrealized gain on investments              905,781        --\n                                                   ---------   ---------\n\n                                                   $ 754,821   $    -0-\n                                                   =========   =========\n\n\n                                   (Continued)\n\n                                       -8-\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\n          The Company rents its principal office space from its president on a\n     month-to-month basis at $500 per month.

Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of\n         Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n         Financial Condition.\n\n                  The Company is a development stage company and has had minimal\n         revenue to date. The Company is relying on existing resources to fund\n         its continuing operation. Additional sources of liquidity are expected\n         to be available from the Company\'s investment in H Power Corp.\'s common\n         shares. During the year ended July 31, 1995, the Company wrote the\n         carrying value of this investment to zero due to H Power Corp.\'s\n         continuing losses. On August 10, 2000, H Power Corp. consummated an\n         initial public offering (IPO). In connection with this IPO, H Power\n         Corp. authorized a five to one split, which increased the number of the\n         Company\'s shares to 125,000. In addition, in April 2000, certain\n         parties related to the Company agreed to resign from H Power Corp\'s\n         Board of Directors and accept certain restrictions on voting and\n         transferring their shares and seeking proxies. Consequently, the group\n         of related parties and affiliates no longer exercises significant\n         influence over H Power Corp. and, beginning in the quarter ending\n         October 31, 2000, the Company accounted for the investment as\n         available-for sale marketable equity securities. In prior periods the\n         investment was accounted for using the equity method. At October 31,\n         2000, the H Power Corp. shares had a quoted market price of $21.3125,\n         for a total investment of $2,664,063. On this basis, the Company\n         reported for the months ended October 31, 2000 other comprehensive\n         income from unrealized gain on securities of $1,758,283, net of income\n         taxes of $905,781. The increase in its investment in H Power Corp.\n         shares was partially offset by a deferred income tax liability of\n         $754,821, comprising of gross deferred tax liabilities from such\n         unrealized gain ($905,781) less the income tax benefit ($150,960)\n         available from net loss carryforwards of approximately $444,000.\n\n         Results of Operations\n\n                  The Company reported net income of $128,394 for the\n         three-month period ended October 31, 2000, compared to a net loss of\n         $10,104 for the three-month period ended October 31, 1999. The increase\n         is attributable primarily to an income tax benefit of $150,960. The\n         Company believes that the unrealized gain on its H Power Corp shares\n         makes the realization of deferred tax benefits related to its net\n         operating loss carryforward more likely than not.\n\n<PAGE>\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                         QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2000\n\n                                   SIGNATURES\n\n         Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its\nbehalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\nDATE:                                     DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n\n\n\n                                          By: /s/ Allan Rothstein\n---------------------------                  ----------------------------\n                                                   Allan Rothstein\n                                                   President and Director\n</TEXT>\n</DOCUMENT>\n'
