DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY\n\n          The Company, a Delaware corporation, has been in the development stage\n     since its formation on August 1, 1986. It has not generated operating\n     revenues as of October 31, 2001, and no assurance can be given that it will\n     generate operating revenues and earnings in the future.\n\n\n2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION\n\n          The condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance\n     with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial\n     information and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\n     Exchange Commission. They do not include all of the information and\n     footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete\n     financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments\n     (consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary\n     for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for\n     the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be\n     expected for the full year. The accompanying financial statements should be\n     read in conjunction with the Company\'s audited financial statements and\n     Form 10-k for the year ended July 31, 2001.\n\n\n3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n     Income Taxes\n\n          The Company applies the asset and liability method of accounting for\n     income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and\n     liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences\n     attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying\n     amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.\n     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax\n     rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are\n     expected to be recovered or settled.\n\n\n                                  (Continued)\n\n                                      -5-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\n\n\n3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n\n     Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\n\n          The Company applies SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share", which requires\n     dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for\n     complex capital structures on the face of the statement of operations.\n     Basic and diluted EPS has been computed by dividing the loss by the\n     weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. During\n     the three months ended October 31, 2001, basic and diluted loss per share\n     was less than $.01. The Company has not issued any dilutive potential\n     common stock since inception.\n\n     Investments\n\n\n          At October 31, 2001, the Company held 125,000 common shares of H Power\n     Corp., which are classified as available-for-sale securities.\n     Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized\n     holding gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, are\n     excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of\n     shareholders\' equity. Dividend and interest income are recognized when\n     earned.\n\n          At October 31, 2001, the Company held a twelve-month U.S. Treasury\n     bill with a face value that matures in February 2002. This investment is\n     classified as held-to-maturity and is carried at amortized cost. The fair\n     value of the investment approximates its carrying value due to its short\n     maturity.\n\n\n4 - INVESTMENT IN H POWER CORP.\n\n          Prior to August 1, 2000, the Company accounted for its investment in H\n     Power Corp. using the equity method because it was part of a group of\n     certain related parties and affiliates which owned approximately 18 percent\n     of that corporation. During the year ended July 31, 1995, the Company\n     recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of value in this investment\n     due to H Power Corp.\'s continuing losses and wrote the carrying value down\n     to zero.\n\n                                  (Continued)\n\n                                      -6-\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\n4 - INVESTMENT IN H POWER CORP. (continued)\n\n          On August 10, 2000, H Power Corp. consummated an initial public\n     offering ("IPO"). In July 2000, in connection with the IPO, H Power Corp.\n     authorized a five-for-one split. In addition, in April 2000, certain\n     parties related to the Company agreed to resign from H Power Corp.\'s Board\n     of Directors and accept certain restrictions on voting and transferring\n     their shares and seeking proxies. Consequently, the group of related\n     parties and affiliates no longer exercises significant influence over H\n     Power Corp. and, beginning in the quarter ended October 31, 2000, the\n     Company accounted for the investment as available-for-sale marketable\n     equity securities. The unrealized holding (loss) gain on the H Power Corp.\n     shares, which are reflected in other comprehensive income, was $(390,000)\n     and $2,664,063 for the three months ended October 31, 2001 and 2000,\n     respectively. At October 31, 2001, the H Power Corp. shares had a quoted\n     market price of $2.91 per share, for a total investment of $363,750.\n\n\n5 - INCOME TAXES\n\n          The primary components of the Company\'s deferred tax assets and\n     liabilities and the related valuation allowances are as follows:\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n\n\n                                                        Three Months Ended October 31,\n                                                        ------------------------------\n                                                          2001                  2000\n                                                          ----                  ----\n<S>                                                   <C>                   <C>\n          Gross deferred tax assets\n            Net operating loss carryforwards          $    162,860          $    150,960\n\n          Valuation allowance                               39,185                 -\n                                                      ------------          ------------\n\n                                                           123,675               150,960\n\n          Gross deferred tax liabilities\n            Unrealized gain on investments                 123,675               905,781\n                                                      ------------          ------------\n\n                                                      $     -0-             $    754,821\n                                                      ============          ============\n\n</TABLE>\n\n(Continued)\n\n                                      -7-\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\n5 - INCOME TAXES (Continued)\n\n          At October 31, 2001, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards\n     of approximately $479,000, expiring during the years 2004 to 2021,\n     available to reduce future Federal taxable income. The Company believes\n     that realization of part of the deferred tax asset related to its net\n     operating loss carryforward was more likely than not, based on its\n     accumulated unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of $363,750 at\n     October 31, 2001. In 2001, the Company recorded a valuation allowance,\n     partially offsetting the deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance was\n     based on management\'s estimates and analysis that it was more likely than\n     not that the related deferred tax assets would not be realized.\n\n\n6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\n          The Company rents its principal office space from its president on a\n     month-to-month basis at $500 per month.

Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of\n         Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n         ----------------------------------------------\n\n         Financial Condition.\n\n                  The Company is a development stage company and has had minimal\n         revenue to date. The Company is relying on existing resources to fund\n         its continuing operation. Additional sources of liquidity are expected\n         to be available from the Company\'s investment in H Power Corp.\'s common\n         shares. During the year ended July 31, 1995, the Company wrote the\n         carrying value of this investment to zero due to H Power Corp.\'s\n         continuing losses. On August 10, 2000, H Power Corp. consummated an\n         initial public offering (IPO). In connection with this IPO, H Power\n         Corp. authorized a five to one split, which increased the number of the\n         Company\'s shares to 125,000. In addition, in April 2000, certain\n         parties related to the Company agreed to resign from H Power Corp\'s\n         Board of Directors and accept certain restrictions on voting and\n         transferring their shares and seeking proxies. Consequently, the group\n         of related parties and affiliates no longer exercises significant\n         influence over H Power Corp. and, beginning in the quarter ending\n         October 31, 2000, the Company accounted for the investment as\n         available-for sale marketable equity securities. In prior periods the\n         investment was accounted for using the equity method. At October 31,\n         2001, the H Power Corp. shares had a quoted market price of $2.91 per\n         share, for a total investment of $363,750. On this basis, the Company\n         reported at October 31, 2001, an unrealized holding loss on the H Power\n         shares in the amount of $390,000, less the income tax benefit\n         ($132,600) available from net loss carryforwards of approximately\n         $479,000.\n\n\n\n         Results of Operations\n\n                  The Company reported a net loss of $18,540 for the three-month\n         period ended October 31, 2001, compared to a net income of $128,394 for\n         the three-month period ended October 31, 2000. The income reported for\n         the period ended October 31, 2000 was attributable primarily to an\n         income tax benefit of $150,960, which resulted from the Company\'s\n         belief that realization of deferred tax benefits respecting its net\n         operating loss carryforward was more likely than not.\n\n\n<PAGE>\n                              DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n                          (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)\n\n                         QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2001\n\n\n                                   SIGNATURES\n                                   ----------\n\n\n         Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its\nbehalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\n\n\n\nDATE:                                       DYNAMARK CORPORATION\n\n\n\n                                            By:\n--------------------------------               --------------------------------\n                                                         Allan Rothstein\n                                                         President and Director\n\n\n\n\n</TEXT>\n</DOCUMENT>\n'
